**WCH Headliners at FilmOneFest **

Working Class Hussys played to their largest crowd yet last Saturday night when they headlined at the FilmOneFest (the Atlantic Highlands One-Minute International Film Festival) in New Jersey's Atlantic Highlands. The crowd of about 2500 also screened amateur films from all around the world. Although the set was cut slightly short due to a threat of rain, it was great to hear the opening acts 'Rockit' and 'Crimson Sky'. WCH would like to thank the organization for inviting us to play. We would also like to shout out to our band members, Mike McClellan, Tony Mann, Patricia Crowell, Ian Patrick Gentles, Greg Winka, and Brian Casale for putting on a great show. Thank you so much, Film One Fest, and we hope to see you there again next year. FilmOneFest is the Jersey Shore's preeminent showcase for all forms of short films under two minutes in length. The festival is a free summertime seaside screening in the town of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. Its goal is to raise awareness of the arts, as well as the community of Atlantic Highlands. FilmOneFest also promotes local and international filmmaking through the use of new media and technology, educational activities and screenings, and supports its local food bank.
